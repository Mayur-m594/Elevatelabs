I have learnt how to analyze a phishing email by examining the sender details, email headers, suspicious links, attachments, and social engineering techniques. 
Through this task, I identified multiple phishing indicators such as spoofed domains, failed authentication checks, urgent language, and malicious URLs. 
This repository contains all analysis files and the final report summarizing my findings. 
Overall, this task helped me understand how phishing attacks work and how to detect them effectively.
